# Statistical Inference Course Examples

This folder acts as my practice folder where I draw difference inference from the dataset provided by the http://pluto.huji.ac.il/~msby/StatThink/Datasets. 

# Example 1

The dataset is taken from the http://pluto.huji.ac.il/~msby/StatThink/Datasets/aids.csv. This dataset contains the three variable namely

`Year`- The relevant year where there is number of AIDS cases<br>
`diagnosed`- The number of people diagnosed by the AIDS in each year<br>
`deaths`- The number of deaths related to the AIDS in each year

When we consider the `death` as a response variable and the `diagnosed` as the explanatory variable, then the regression model follows the increasing linear trends as follows:

The red line in the scatterplot is the regression line created by our linear model. The linear model predict that the people who are diagnosed with the `AIDS` are likely to death and follows the increasing linear trends.
